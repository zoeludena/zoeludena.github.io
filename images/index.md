# Methodology Assignment 5, Task 2

## Who am I?
My name is Zoe Ludena and my UCSD email is `zludena@ucsd.edu`.

## DSC 180 Mentor and Capstone
I am part of the Deep Learning for Climate Model Emulation in Section `B13`. I am being taught by Duncan Watson-Parris.

## Quarter 2 Project Proposal
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was learning the process of how the data was stored and then used inside different models. I explored the Gaussian model and Random Forest. It was so interesting to see both of them create wonderful predictions with different strengths. They do a very good job in comparison to the super computer, which is costly (economically and time-wise).

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
My team and I are hoping to pursue the question: "How can we characterize natural disaster risks of high impact regions in different SSPs using climate model emulators and what are their uncertainties?" We were drawn to this question because Duncan told us last year a team did some research on the factors that would increase wildfires. We were hoping to look at high impact regions and determine if they are in more danger for certain natural disasters and the uncertainties associated with them. For example, the Sahara Desert has a low uncertainty of a drought. Another project we had thought about was doing something with radiation. We were given papers like "Earth's Global Energy Budget" and "Constraints on future changes in climate and the hydrologic cycle." These were super interesting to me. It was cool to learn more about how radiation is being measured and used, the uncertainties with current models, and what we would need to be careful of.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
We are focusing on specific areas instead of the whole world. We are going to use the variables available to use to focus on the impact climate change will have around the world. We will be incorporating other models that already exist that also take in the variables we already have to help us find what will happen.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Personally, other techniques I would be interested in using in our project would be exploring other models or creating a function that would take in a location and provide information about natural disasters that could happen in a certain time frame. We have a lot of good models at our disposal like pattern scaling, neural networks, gaussian, and random forest, but it would also be cool to explore new ones like boosting to combine model strengths. I am also curious to know if incorporating geospatial analysis tools coudl provide a more comprehensive perspective.
