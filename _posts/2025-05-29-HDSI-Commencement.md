### Outstanding Capstone Project Award
This award recognizes the student(s) whose capstone project and presentations showed exemplary preparation and execution.

My capstone project, SeeRise: Visualizing Emulated Sea Level Rise on Coastal Regions, received the most votes in the second session of the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute Capstone Showcase 2025. There were 72 projects in total, but 42 projects in the second session. We showcased our research to over 600 attendees!

### Outstanding Tutor Award
This award recognizes the student whose tutoring tenure and experiences helped uplift the student's academic experiences at HDSI. Proudly, I can say I was the only student who received this award this year!

I tutored for DSC 10: Principles of Data Science, DSC 20: Programming and Basic Data Structures for Data Science, DSC 30: Data Structures and Algorithms for Data Science, DSC 40A: Theoretical Foundations of Data Science I, and DSC 140A: Probabilistic Modeling and Machine Learning. I also helped with DSC 95: Tutor Apprenticeship in Data Science by attending Tutor Panels.

I loved my time as a tutor at HDSI. It was a rewarding experience where I connected with both lower- and upperclassmen, shared exciting and complex concepts in engaging ways, and contributed to the development of resources for future students. I also had the privilege of building meaningful relationships with the faculty, whose mentorship played a key role in my growth as an educator.
