### Peer Recognition Award

This award, signed by the Sheriff and accompanied by a write-up of my accomplishments, recognizes employees who demonstrate extraordinary effort, productivity, performance, and a job well done. I was truly honored to be acknowledged for my contributions to the Management Services Bureau and for representing SDSO with a high standard of service.

The recognition stemmed from my work on the Facility Maintenance Power BI Report, a project I collaborated on closely with Holly Porter. Our goal was to create a centralized, dynamic reporting tool that could give command staff a clear picture of ongoing and completed maintenance projects across all facilities.

To achieve this, we built an interactive report that included:

- An ArcGIS-powered map to visualize facility locations.

- Real-time tables and cards summarizing maintenance status.

- Automatic weekly updates powered by Azure Pipelines and Power Automate.

- A clean, intuitive layout tailored for leadership visibility.

What made this project particularly rewarding was the response from leadership and end-users. The report quickly became a high-demand tool across the department, enabling command staff to understand facility needs at a glance and make faster, more informed decisions. The interest it generated also led me to mentor other organizations in creating their own versions of the report, expanding the impact far beyond our initial scope.

Receiving the Peer Recognition Award for this work validated not only the technical side of the project but also the collaboration, service, and commitment behind it. I’m grateful for the opportunity to support SDSO in meaningful ways—and excited for the projects still ahead.
