            <h2>
            As you may have guessed, my name is Zoe Ludena!
            I am currently an undergraduate student attending the University of California, San Diego. I am a Data Science Major in Revelle College with a Business Economics minor.
            I am set to graduate Winter Quarter 2025.
            <br>
            <br>
            A fun fact about me is before college I knew nothing about coding! From middle school to the end of high school I studied opera and thought I would become a singer.
            Covid, like for many others, turned my world upside down as I realized singing would be an unstable profession in the fear of another pandemic.
            That being said, I have fallen in love with everything Data Science. I have had the greatest privledge being taught and mentored by some of the finest minds at UCSD.
            I've come a long way and hope to continue to grow!
            <br>
            <br>
            Some other interests I have are hiking, baking, and art!
