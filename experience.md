  <summary>ðŸ’¬ Standout Comments from Students</summary>

<div markdown="1">
  - *"SO friendly and kind and warm and encouraging- this particularly was so important in a rigorous class like DSC 40A where students (like myself) began to feel unsure/scared and fall behind. Zoe's genuine care about the students and passion for teaching was such a standout of this quarter. Not only was she very knowledgeable and explain things in a clear way, but she also gave constant encouragement and went above and beyond in reaching out to students and getting to know them and their academic needs on an individual level."*   (DSC40A, Spring 2024)
  - *"THE ABSOLUTE GOAT. Zoe is hands down the best tutor of any of the DSC20 staff. A lot of tutors have to refer back to the answer key to solve problems, Zoe helps you brainstorm and work through them and doesn't need the answer key because she knows the material so well and is incredibly smart. She is also the nicest person ever and someone I felt very comfortable getting help from, she never made me feel stupid and created such a welcoming environment."* (DSC20, Winter 2024)
  - *"Zoe is so caring and intelligent! Her biweekly office hours were the ones I made sure to attend regularly since she has been the sole tutor who will actually walk me through my errors during the debugging process in a manner that allows me to grasp from my mistakes the difficult concepts covered in class. Her support is a vital part of any success Iâ€™ve had thus far, so Iâ€™m very grateful!"* (DSC 30, Fall 2023)
