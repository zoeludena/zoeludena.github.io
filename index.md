## About   

#### A fun fact about me:  
Before college, I knew nothing about coding! From middle school to the end of high school, I studied opera and thought I would become a singer.  
COVID, like for many others, turned my world upside down as I realized singing would be an unstable profession in the fear of another pandemic.  
That being said, I have fallen in love with everything Data Science. I have had the greatest privilege of being taught and mentored by some of the finest minds at UCSD.  
I've come a long way and hope to continue to grow!  

Some of my other interests include:  
🎨 **Art**  
🥾 **Hiking**  
🍰 **Baking**
